## üö® The Problem

In Nigeria and across Africa, hospital finance teams spend countless hours manually cross-referencing submitted claim invoices with complex payout summaries received from insurers and HMOs. This manual process is:
* **Slow & Tedious:** Wasting hours that could be spent on higher-value tasks.
* **Error-Prone:** Leading to missed discrepancies and significant revenue leakage.
* **Opaque:** It's often difficult to understand *why* a particular service was underpaid or denied without a lengthy investigation.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

**InvoiceMatch.AI** transforms this process. We provide a simple, clean interface where a finance officer can upload both the original invoice and the insurer's payout summary.

Our AI-powered engine then instantly:
1.  **Parses Both Documents:** Intelligently extracts line items, service descriptions, and amounts from both files.
2.  **Matches Line Items:** Correlates each billed service with its corresponding payment.
3.  **Highlights Discrepancies:** Pinpoints every underpayment, overpayment, or outright denial, calculating the exact financial variance.
4.  **Generates an Executive Summary:** Provides a clear, natural language explanation of the reconciliation results, suggesting which items require immediate follow-up.
